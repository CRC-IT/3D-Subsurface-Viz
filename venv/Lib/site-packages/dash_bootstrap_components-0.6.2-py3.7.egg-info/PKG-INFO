Description: # dash-bootstrap-components
        
        [Plotly Dash][dash-homepage] is great! However, creating the initial
        layout can create a lot of boilerplate. *dash-bootstrap-components*
        reduces this boilerplate by providing standard layouts and high-level
        components.
        
        *dash-bootstrap-components* provides [Bootstrap][bootstrap-homepage]
        components. It is built on top of [reactstrap][reactstrap-homepage].
        
        ## Installation

        running
        
        ```
        pip install dash-bootstrap-components
