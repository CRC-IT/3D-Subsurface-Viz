# Project_Texas

Project Texas is a 3D Visualization pipeline to display the well bores in subsurface space. 
This interactive dashboard helps engineers conceptualize the proximity of given wells and its trajectories. By giving a 3d view along with contextual information (perfs, fracs, well status, etc.), engineers can access relevant data in one location.

Users will input well names according to its correlated region, and the app will populate those wells in 3D space along with any nearby faults taken into consideration.
This is built with Dash, an interactive Python framework developed by Plotly.
